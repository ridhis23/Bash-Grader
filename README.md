# Bash-Grader

Java Grading Server with Bash Integration

A simple Java server that automates the grading process for Java assignments by executing Bash scripts. The server accepts a repository URL via query parameters, clones the repository, compiles the student's code, and runs tests. The server returns the results of the grading process, including errors and test outcomes.
